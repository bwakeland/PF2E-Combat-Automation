# FoundryVTT Module for Pathfinder 2e

Automatically calculates hits, misses, crits, and crit-fails. Displays the result of the attack on the targeted unit by
comparing to AC. Puts the result into chat, whispers the GM privately the difference between the result and the target
in case manual adjustment is needed.
To install module use: https://github.com/bwakeland/PF2E-Combat-Automation/releases/latest/download/module.json
